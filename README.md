          Typography

          The main font is "ROBOTO" Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. 
          At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves.
           While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width.
           This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.
